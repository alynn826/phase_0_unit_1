# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
My biggest time management challenge is my job.  I currently work 40+ hours as a consultant and my commitment to my client ultimately has to take frontseat at this moment. I also have to fly to Oahu quit often on the weekends to do business meetings.  Normally it isn't this busy but with the high travel season coming to Maui, the company has to do a lot of preparation for its summer expansions. I can only work on the DBC stuff late at night after I'm done with working out logistics and answer employees' questions. Part of the biggest challenge I have is switching off my "consultant" brain and turning on "the student" brain and vice versa. It's been difficult juggling the two but I'm sure I'm not the only one experiencing this. 
* How will you combat that? 
I plan on gradually lessen my work as a consultant as Phase 1 gets closer so I can focus solely on the schoolwork. I will also set aside certain amount of hours each day to work on the assignments bit by bit instead of waiting till later part of the week to start. I will also try to calm my mind by using meditation so I don't feel so overwhelmed all the time.  
* What techniques will you try?
I will try to use mediatation and the Pomodoro technique to help re-focus my mind for schoolwork.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
My overall plan is:

1. Eventually quit my work as a Retail Strategy Consultant and solely focus on DBC work.

2. I will remember to slow down, re-focus myself, and celebrate the small triumphs instead of dwelling on my fear.

3. I will set aside a block of time each day of the week to work on my DBC stuff.

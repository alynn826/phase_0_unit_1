# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I think they are a good thing espcially in a field that's already very confusing with all the different languages, browsers,...etc. I believe the average enduser expects a website to look a certain way regardless of which browser or device they use. Some people might argue that standardization of anything kills creativity but I argue that it actually requires more creativity and problem solving to think outside the box when constrained by standardization. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
Yes it does because I think it makes it easier from a group design point of view if everyone already has a general idea of how something should look (structurally at least). Minimizes confusion. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
I can see how these elements will streamline the look of the html file so you're not dealing with so many divs.  However, the it seems even the seasoned developers are somewhat unsure about the outline algorithm for HTML5.  I think overtime once everyone is used to it, it will be a good thing. 
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
A CSS reset is necessary because different browsers have its own default stylesheets and this could be problematic if you want your website to look the same on every browser. The reset forces the browser's styles reset to null and minimizes the differences between browsers. 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do? I have used IE, Chrome, and Safari and yes I've noticed the differences between them. For example, I can open www.devbootcamp.com just fine in my Safari but my Chrome can't even find it which is strange to me.  
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

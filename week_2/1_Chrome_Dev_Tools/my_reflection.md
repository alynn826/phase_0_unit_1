# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

DOM is something that allows developers make dynamic webpages instead of just static ones. It basically says that a website is a document and the HTML elements are all objects within that document. It charts the objects in a tree-like formation where the developer can access each nodes (objects) by locating its place on the tree. From a learning perspective it's good that it allows you to make interactive webpages, the bad is that it's one of those nebulous concepts that's a little difficult to understand its exact role. 
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

It was interesting to see two similarly basic blog pages have very different issues in terms of optimizing the performances. Using Pagespeed, I saw that it was mostly the images that are slowing down the loading time of my website whereas the main issue with the Wordpress blog I visited was how to minimize redirects. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
I can certainly see its usefulness especially in identifying bugs and optimizing performance in real time.  It is still new and confusing to me but I'm sure with all new things being learned, it will become second nature to me. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

My "aha" moment was when I learned why some websites loads slower than others.  I used to thing it was just a speed issue with the internet.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

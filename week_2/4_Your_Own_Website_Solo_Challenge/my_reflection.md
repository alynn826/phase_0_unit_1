# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: https://alynn826.github.io/unit1_projects/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
I learned although design and user experience are different things they are intertwined. Going through the planning and wireframing process made me more consciencious of how I want the webpage to look and feel for the users. 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I liked thinking about how I want to layout the website so I suppose I enjoyed the wireframe part. 
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
-thought about what I wanted to convey to the user
-layout the webpage
-code
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I would like to add more graphics and be able to skip to different sections of the page. 
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
I think this week's challenge is definitely harder than last but I did get to play around with the Devtool as wells learned how to import fonts.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

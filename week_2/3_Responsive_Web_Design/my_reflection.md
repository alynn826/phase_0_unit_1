# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
Responsive web design is designing a website that is flexible and able to fit properly on the screen of any devices. I think it's a great practice since with how fast technology develops, it's important to build websites that are scalable. 
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
The creation of smartphones and tablets have encouraged developers to come up with new ways to accommodate the different screen sizes of devices. It means having to design with the future in mind and static designs are no longer sufficient.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them? 
Visually impaired people use Screen Readers to use the web. I think web design isn't just about displaying information or pretty images...it is also about how it can enrich our lives through interactions between people who otherwise would never have met in real life.I believe for that reason accessibility for all is important when we design websites. 
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense? 
Truthfully I had no idea that there were such a thing as Screen Readers for the visually impaired to use the web. After reading about Web Accessibility, it really opened up my eyes on the possibilities of web design I didn't know was possible before. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

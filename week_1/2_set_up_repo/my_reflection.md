* When a software program is "open source" it means its source codes are open for the public to see, modify, and distribute as they see fit.

* I think Open Source is a good thing overall since it encourages programmers to collaborate with each other and would-be programmers to learn.  Although at the same time I can understand why not all programs are Open Source since companies are there to make money from the programs they develop.

* I believe licenses are necessary in order to protect the rights of the original creator of a program.  Without licensing anyone can just take any code and modify it and distribute it however they want whether or not it's the creator's wish. 

* It was nice to finally know how to start using GitHub.  It was a little overwhelming when I first logged into GitHub since I only had a vague idea of what it is.  The "aha" moment moment was when I understood what exactly is a repository on GitHub. Also I did not know that even Open Source projects have licenses but it made sense after reading the material.

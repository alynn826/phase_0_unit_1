* I was having issue positioning an element in the center of the browser so I reviewed the section on margin in Codecademy and made it work.

* I am still having trouble with positioning the elements in the exact place I want them to be.  It was a lot of trial and error before I figured some of the stuff out. I plan on using the tutoring session I have coming up to solidify my knowledge.

* For me it was learning how to break down each element properly in CSS so I can position correctly

* I believe I am fairly confident on the HTML part and CSS I am comfortable with everything except positioning.  That is something I still need to work on.

* Despite the troubles I had with positioning it was both frustrating and rewarding at the same time.  It's a good feeling when you figure out a solution and see it work out right before you. 

* I had to debug some of my codes and it was tedious because it was all very minor, easily missed things so I had to read the codes several times to find the problem.

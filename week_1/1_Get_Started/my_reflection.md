## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* I really had no trouble setting up git except I had to go into my System Preferences to change the security setting in order to install git.  GitHub was a bit more confusing especially the part on generating SSH key but I just went online to search for more clear instructions and was able to generate the keys I needed. 

* git is a version control tool that allows you to track and/or revert changes when working on a coding project. GitHub is a social coding website that allows you to host git repositories both publicly and privately. Users can post codes for others to use or contribute to or learn from.  

* Version control is a tool that allows multi-layered collaboration and track and/or reverts changes on any type of project.  GitHub helps by letting users contribute to Open source projects and encourages collaboration between coders. GitHub users can also post their own codes for others to use or contribute to.

* Developers use version control so multiple people can work on parts of the same project simultaneously without getting them mixed up or accidentally overwritten.  Version control makes absolute sense to me because without it it will get chaotic very quickly if you have multiple people changing different parts of the same project and there's no way to track the changes.  Version control makes complex collaboration between multiple people possible and thereby allows a team to tackle bigger projects more efficiently.  

* This last question is a bit confusing.  Is it asking me whether the idea of version control makes sense to me (which was already asked in the question above) Or is it asking me what part of the materials I read doesn't make sense?

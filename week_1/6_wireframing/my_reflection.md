* I learned design is not just something that's part of a end product, it is a way of thinking.  Design thinking involves both analytics and creativity. It is a way of thinking that correctly identify and empathize the needs of the enduser. It is important to research and learn from the user experience so you can apply to future improvements on the design.  

* I do enjoy design and user experience as I spent a lot of time making adjustments to my site to make it as visually appealing as I'm able to now. I liked the wireframing because it helped organize my thoughts on how a web page should look.

* This challenge was not particularly hard compare to the ones. The concepts introduced here are not new to me since I have seen design thinking working as a Project Manager.  

* The new skill would be learning how to wireframe a web page.  It really makes you pay attention to not just how a web page should look but also whether it's addressing the enduser's needs. 

* I enjoyed doing the wireframing because it helped organize my thoughts and remind me what issues I'll be addressing with the web page.


* I I liked all the reading material here except for the one from wikipedia.  I thought it was too long and delved to much into the history of design thinking. As a enduser of these web pages, I preferred the practical concise articles that get to the meat of the concept.

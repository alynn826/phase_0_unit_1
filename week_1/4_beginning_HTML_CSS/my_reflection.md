 *It made sense to me HTML is setup like the bone structure of a webpage. You can see the general layout of the webpage even as you're writing the codes. So far nothing doesn't make sense to me yet but I'm sure I'll find something as I delve deeper.

 * I think the best thing about HTML is that its syntax is fairly intuitive for a beginner to learn.  It was almost like writing out in normal English except you're dealing with tags here. The bad thing is memorizing all the different tags and you have tags that do similar things. 

 * One of the "aha" moment was understanding the difference between Class and ID adn their usage. I had a bit of trouble understanding it with Codecademy but reading the GDT slide clarified it. 

 * I didn't have to look up additional resources here since the basics were easy enough to grasp.

## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do. 


#### add
the add command stages the files that are ready to be committed and tell Git to start tracking changes made to the file. 

#### branch
makes a copy of the master that you can make separate commits to.

#### checkout
changes the file back to how it was at the last commit. Use to switch between branches.

#### clone
makes a copy of an existing git repository.

#### commit
takes a snapshot of the change you've made to the file and store it to the repository. 

#### fetch
Similar to git pull except it won't do any merge. It creates a local copy of the remote branch.

#### log
a record of all the changes you've made to the repository.

#### merge
merges the changes you've made on a branch into the master branch.

#### pull
pull the changes other people have made to your project.  

#### push
tells git where to place the commits.

#### reset
unstages a file

#### rm
stage the files you want to remove and also removes the files.

#### status
git status allows you to check the current state of the project you're working on in the repository.
